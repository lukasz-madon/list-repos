  "readme": "Protractor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular/protractor.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular/protractor)\n==========\n\nProtractor is an end to end test framework for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) applications built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.\n\nProtractor can be run as a standalone binary, or included into your tests as a library. Use [Protractor as a library](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/library-only.md) if you would like to manage WebDriver and your test setup yourself.\n\nFor more information\n - [read the docs](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs/getting-started.md)\n - [Read the FAQ](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/faq.md)\n - See the [supported browsers](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs/browser-setup.md)\n - [See the API](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/api.md)\n\nTo run the sample tests\n-----------------------\n\nInstall protractor with.\n\n    npm install -g protractor\n\nStart up a selenium server (See the appendix below for help with this). By default, the tests expect the selenium server to be running at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`.\n\nThe node module's example folder contains a simple test suite which runs against angularjs.org. Run with: \n\n    protractor example/conf.js\n\n\nUsing the Protractor runner\n---------------------------\n\nThe Protractor runner is a binary which accepts a config file. Install protractor with\n\n    npm install -g protractor\n    # Run the line below to see command line options\n    protractor\n\nYou will need a *configuration file* containing setup info and *test files* containing the actual test scripts. The config file specifies how the runner should start webdriver, where your test files are, and global setup options. The test files use Jasmine framework by default ([read about using mocha instead](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs/using-mocha.md)).\n\nCreate a configuration file - an example with detailed comments is shown in `node_modules/protractor/referenceConf.js`. Edit the configuration file to point to your test files.\n\n```javascript\n// myConf.js\nexports.config = {\n  seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',\n  specs: ['myTest.js', 'myTestFolder/*Test.js']\n}\n```\n\nThe configuration file must specify a way to connect to webdriver. This can be\n *   `seleniumAddress`: The address of a running selenium server.\n *   `seleniumServerJar`: The location of the selenium standalone .jar file on your machine. Protractor will use this to start up the selenium server.\n *   `sauceUser` and `sauceKey`: The username and key for a [SauceLabs](http://www.saucelabs.com) account. Protractor will use this to run tests on SauceLabs.\n If none of the above are specific, Protractor will try to start the standalone .jar from the default location in node_modules/protractor/selenium.\n\nThe runner exposes global variables `browser`, `by` and `element`. Check out [getting started docs](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) to learn how to write a test.\n\n```javascript\n// myTest.js\ndescribe('angularjs homepage', function() {\n  it('should greet the named user', function() {\n    browser.get('http://www.angularjs.org');\n\n    element(by.model('yourName')).sendKeys('Julie');\n\n    var greeting = element(by.binding('yourName'));\n\n    expect(greeting.getText()).toEqual('Hello Julie!');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nRun with\n\n    protractor myConf.js\n\n\nCloning and running Protractor's own tests\n------------------------------------------\nClone the github repository.\n\n    git clone https://github.com/angular/protractor.git\n    cd protractor\n    npm install\n\nStart up a selenium server. By default, the tests expect the selenium server to be running at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`.\n\nProtractor's test suite runs against the included testapp. Start that up with\n\n    npm start\n\nThen run the tests with\n\n    npm test\n\n\nAppendix A: Setting up a standalone selenium server\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWebdriverJS does not natively include the selenium server - you must start a standalone selenium server. All you need is the latest [selenium-server-standalone.](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html). To drive individual browsers, you may need to install separate driver binaries.\n\nTo use with chrome browsers, [download chromedriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html).\n[More information about chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)\n\nThe `webdriver-manager` script is included in the npm package to manage downloads for you. To see the options, run\n\n    npm install -g protractor\n    webdriver-manager\n\nDownload and start the selenium server with\n\n    webdriver-manager update\n    webdriver-manager start\n\nNote the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) is also required to run the webdriver. You may have to download and install it if your computer does not already have it.\n\nFor alternate ways to download and start the selenium standalone, see\n[the webdriver docs](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#running-standalone-selenium-server-for-use-with-remotedrivers).\n",
